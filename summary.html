                            <p>Your WMC value is too high. 
                                Consider lowering the number of methods per class and/or their complexity. 
                                The higher the WMC is, the more time and effort it takes to develop and support the class. 
                                High WMC also leads to more errors/faults, as well as limits reuse.</p>

                            <p>Your DIT value is too high. 
                                Consider combining classes to reduce the use of inheritance. 
                                The higher the depth of the inheritance tree, the more complex and harder to handle the software becomes.</p>

                            <p>Your NOC value is too high. 
                                Consider restructuring your subclasses by combining classes to reduce the level of complexity towards the top-end of the inheritance tree. 
                                A high level of NOC indicates a high level of reuse of the base class, which has the potential to affect a significant number of subclasses.</p>

                                Consider reducing the number of collaborator classes by combining similar collaborators. 
                                The higher the level of coupling, the lower the possibility of reuse, and the higher the possibility for errors and difficulties when maintaining the class.</p>

                                Consider reducing the number of operations that may execute in response to a userâ€™s input. 
                                A high level of RFC indicates high complexity, and therefore a higher chance for bugs and a long/complicated debugging process.</p>

                                Consider reevaluating your class structure to ensure similar objectives are addressed in the same class, and disjoint objectives are addressed in different classes. 
                                Classes with high LCOM values are error prone, difficult to test, and would be better served split into different classes.</p>
